# Iteration 0
This is our overview where we organize the Commons Stack Core Team's efforts

With [Iteration 0](https://medium.com/commonsstack/celebrating-progress-one-year-into-the-commons-stack-journey-871d08e5f3b4) of the Commons Stack our focus is on staging the cultural, legal and technical initialization tools required to have the first Commons (Purpose-driven economies that use and Augmented Bonding Curve that feeds into a Conviction Voting DAO) be able to be launched. 

We manage this work in [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/commons-stack-workspace-5f1206c0362e7b000fc0161b/board) which we will continue to keep updated. 

**You can support our mission** first and foremost by **[donating](http://commonsstack.org/donate)**. You can also **contribute time** to the Commons Stack mission, find out more about this by [joining our community.](http://commonsstack.org/community)

Know that with these extra funds you will not only be supporting us as a core team, but a wide network of contributors, and every DAI contributed is spent transparently on the [Giveth DApp](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5d110631994eac53adc8f21e).

With these funds we will accomplish the following **key goals**: 
- Launch our first Commons for the Token Engineering Community
- Finalize the Commons Simulator, a cadCAD-powered game illustrating how the Commons Stack will work
- Create the First DApp that makes it's users a legal member of a Swiss Association
- Research and communicate on our initialization tools and planned components 
- Continue to grow the Trusted Seed, and be an anchor for the Commons movement
